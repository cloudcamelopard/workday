#### Example how to use
To set up a WorkCalendar you:

calendar.WorkdayStart = new TimeOfDay(8, 0);
calendar.WorkdayEnd = new  TimeOfDay(16, 0);
calendar.AddHolidays(new RecurringHoliday(Month.May, 17));
calendar.AddHolidays(new SingleHoliday(2004, Month.May, 27));
```
This can be written a bit compacter:
```
var calendar = new WorkdayCalendar() {
	WorkdayStart = 8, WorkdayEnd = 16
}.AddHolidays(new RecurringHoliday(Month.May, 17), new SingleHoliday(2004, Month.May, 27));
```
Here is complete code to test the WorkdayCalendar in a simple console:
```
using  WorkdayCalendarLib;

class  Program
{
	static void Main()
	{
		var  calendar = new  WorkdayCalendar() {
			WorkdayStart = 8, WorkdayEnd = 16,
		}.AddHolidays(new RecurringHoliday(Month.May, 17), new SingleHoliday(2004, Month.May, 27));

		var start = new DateTime(2004, 5, 24, 18, 5, 0);
		var move = -5.5;
		var result = calendar.AddWorkdays(start, move);
 
		Console.WriteLine("From {0} and move {1} workdays you end up on {2}", start, move, result);
	}
}
```
